# üè∑Ô∏è Customer Segmentation System

A comprehensive, science-driven solution for **segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior and income**, powered by Machine Learning. This project delivers an end-to-end workflow‚Äîcovering everything from data cleaning and feature engineering, through robust clustering and validation, to insightful visualizations and actionable business insights. With clean, modular code and professional documentation, this system empowers data analysts, marketers, and business leaders to understand their customer base at a deeper level and make targeted, data-driven decisions.

## üåü Why Customer Segmentation?

Understanding the diversity of your customer base is critical for business growth. By grouping customers into meaningful segments (such as VIPs, low spenders, and average buyers), businesses can:

- Personalize marketing campaigns for higher conversion.
- Optimize resource allocation and product offerings.
- Identify high-value customers for loyalty programs.
- Detect underserved segments and new business opportunities.
- Enhance overall customer satisfaction and retention.

## üöÄ Features

- **Complete Machine Learning Pipeline:**  
  From initial data ingestion and cleaning, through feature engineering, clusterability assessment, clustering, and visualization.

- **Advanced Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Removal of irrelevant or noisy features.
  - Creation of powerful new features (e.g., total `Spent`).
  - Automated handling of missing data and outliers.

- **Scientific Clusterability Validation:**  
  - Use of **Silhouette Score** and **Hopkins Statistic** to ensure clustering is meaningful and reliable.

- **Flexible Clustering Algorithms:**  
  - Built-in support for KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, and easy extension to others (e.g., DBSCAN).
  - Dynamic selection of cluster count with robust validation.

- **Intuitive Cluster Naming:**  
  - Automatic, human-friendly cluster labels based on behavioral statistics (e.g., "VIP", "Low Spender", "Average").

- **Professional Visualization:**  
  - Clear, publication-ready barplots (cluster sizes) and scatterplots (e.g., `Spent` vs. `Income`) with color-coded cluster labels.
  - Easily customizable to highlight other features.

- **Modular, Well-Documented Codebase:**  
  - Functions and classes for each stage, facilitating adaptation and extension for new data, business rules, or research.

- **Business-Focused Outputs:**  
  - Actionable summaries of each segment to directly inform marketing and product strategy.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How It Works

1. **Data Loading & Preparation**
    - Load customer data from CSV, database, or other sources.
    - Clean, preprocess, and engineer features (e.g., aggregate product spending into a single `Spent` feature).

2. **Clusterability Assessment**
    - Statistically evaluate whether the data has a meaningful cluster structure using Silhouette Score and Hopkins Statistic.
    - If data is not clusterable, receive actionable recommendations for next steps.

3. **Clustering**
    - Select and configure your clustering algorithm (KMeans, Agglomerative, etc.).
    - Optimize the number of clusters (e.g., using the elbow method or silhouette analysis).
    - Assign each customer to a cluster.

4. **Cluster Profiling & Labeling**
    - Calculate statistics (means, medians) for key features within each cluster.
    - Assign descriptive English labels to each cluster based on behavioral patterns.

5. **Visualization & Interpretation**
    - Visualize cluster sizes with barplots.
    - Generate scatterplots (e.g., Spent vs. Income) colored by cluster labels for easy interpretation.
    - Summarize and describe the business characteristics of each segment.

6. **Actionable Insights**
    - Export segment summaries, customer lists, and plots for marketing, sales, or executive presentations.
    - Use segment definitions to power targeted campaigns or loyalty programs.

## üìà Example Outputs

- **Barplot:** Number of customers in each segment (cluster).
- **Scatterplot:** `Spent` vs. `Income` colored by cluster label, for visual exploration.

## ‚ö° Quickstart

### 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare Your Data

- Prepare a customer data file (e.g., CSV or Excel) containing at least `Income`, `Spent`, and other relevant features.
- Adjust feature engineering logic as needed for your business context.

### 3. Run the Analysis

- Launch the provided Jupyter notebook or Python scripts.
- Follow step-by-step cells to preprocess, cluster, analyze, and visualize your data.
